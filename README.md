A Python web scraper using BeautifulSoup toolkit that can extract the roster of inmates (for this specific example) at the Boone County Jail in Missouri from a local government website and save it as comma-delimited text ready for analysis.

Great for extracting user information from sites like LinkedIn and other sites with HTML Tables.
